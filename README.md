# PrayerTime
**Calculation of prayer times is based on complex algorithms**<br>
**Algorithms were written in this project to make it easier for programmers and developers and save time in writing these algorithms from the beginning**<br>
<p>You can easily calculate prayer times.<br>
<strong>By year, month, day, time difference, longitude and latitude</strong>, <br>

All you have to do is function call **Methods()** <br>
function **Methods()** that takes 6 parameters</p>
**Like**

<p>There are two ways to get prayer times</p>

- Create a new object from Method. Like the previous picture.
- Determine the time format like

- You can have more than one time format
1. H_M_24
2. H_M_S_24
3. HH_MM_AA_12

- call time functions .
